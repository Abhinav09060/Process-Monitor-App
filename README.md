# Process-Monitor-App
Real-time process monitoring dashboard that visualizes CPU, memory, and running processes for quick system diagnostics. Built as part of an Operating Systems project.
# 🖥️ Process Monitor – Real-Time System Dashboard

**Process Monitor** is a simple real-time system monitoring tool that helps visualize **CPU usage, memory consumption, and running processes** in one place.  

It was built as part of an **Operating Systems** course project to understand how process states and resource usage can be tracked and presented in a user-friendly way.
